    Task: Initialize the EmbeddingClient class to connect to Google Cloud's VertexAI for text embeddings.

    The EmbeddingClient class should be capable of initializing an embedding client with specific configurations

    parameters. This setup will allow the class to utilize Google Cloud's VertexAIEmbeddings for processing text queries.

    Parameters:
    - model_name: A string representing the name of the model to use for embeddings.
